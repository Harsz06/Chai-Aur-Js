# ☕ Chai aur JavaScript : Practice & Concepts

This repository follows along with **Hitesh Sir's "Chai aur JavaScript" series**, where I’m revisiting the core and advanced concepts of JavaScript not just to watch, but to **code, practice, and deeply understand** each topic.  

---

## Purpose  
The main goal of this repo is to:
- Strengthen my JavaScript fundamentals through hands-on coding.  
- Practice questions after each concept.  
- Dive into **advanced topics** like:
  - Promises & Async/Await  
  - Getters & Setters  
  - Prototypes & OOP  
  - Closures, Scopes, and Execution Contexts  

---

## What You’ll Find Here  
- Concept-wise folders with example code.  
- Notes and explanations for tricky topics.  
- Practice problems and mini tasks to reinforce learning.

## Why This Repo Exists  
To **build strong JS intuition** — not just syntax.  
Every line of code here is written to understand the *why* behind JavaScript behavior, not just the *how*.  

---

## Reference  
All concepts are inspired and learned from **Hitesh Choudhary Sir’s Chai aur JavaScript** series on YouTube.  
Huge thanks to him for simplifying JS in such an engaging way!
